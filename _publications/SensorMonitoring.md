Developed a sensor system to monitor Strain, Current, and Angle, providing early warnings
for deviations. Signals are conditioned with analog and digital filters via a PIC18F47 microcontroller (dynamic range
60 dB, bandwidth 120 Hz) and continuously compared to predefined thresholds. Detected anomalies trigger alerts
and can be monitored via a web interface.
