The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of the Cooperative SIC technique in cellular networks, both analytically and through simulations. The study aims to derive analytical expressions for SIC under small-scale fading conditions and to assess its benefits across different network configurations, including varying reuse factors, trisector transmitter placements, and power control schemes.
