Electronics Engineer with expertise in signal processing, digital health systems, IoT, and secure networked technologies. My background combines a strong analytical foundation with practical experience in the design, evaluation, and protection of complex electronic and information systems.

I have over two years of professional experience in IT and cybersecurity environments, with solid knowledge of cloud services, digital forensics, and incident response. I am proficient in working with cloud infrastructures, firewalls, SIEM and EDR platforms, and possess a strong foundation in Windows and Linux systems, networking, and security monitoring.

My professional interests focus on integrating security principles into system design and operation, emphasizing resilience, reliability, and informed decision-making. I am particularly interested in approaches where cybersecurity contributes to risk mitigation, trust, and sustainable technological development, especially in systems that process sensitive or large-scale data.
